# Changes:
# - Ordered addition of new variables as new variables are defined
#   (and slightly improved performance as a result)
# - A variable is only checked for inclusion on the current parameters
#   of the function.
# - Qualified (class:fn) names to avoid conflicts with similar variable
#   names in subroutines
# - Simplified grammar merge
# - Use string representation of objects to include more names in grammar
#

# REFACTOR:
# * We need to rethink how grammar is derived for loopy subjects.
#   Rather than merge the grammar at the end of execution, we need to
#   treat each iteration of each loop as a mechanism to produce a simple
#   gramamr, then merge these grammars together at one go.
# * Join the line number to the variable name so that a reassignment is
#   treated as a new variable (but not for a new iteration).
# * We can detect a new loop by looking for reasignment on the same
#   variable with same line number.
#
# * Split the string objects rather than replace with nt_var
# * When looking for old_taints, ensure that the newly replaced stuff
#   is actually better than the old vars
# * Take a leaf out of the regex paper, and allow single character values
#   with no replacements to be embedded directly rather than as a non-terminal.

# TODO:
# * Add string globals to the string parameters and variables
#   being considered for rule replacements.
# * Expand nested objects and include the string variables within
#   them when doing rule replacements.
# * Currently the program does not manage what happens when the
#   same variable is reassigned -- such as during a loop. Fix this
#   so that reassignments are distinguished by a unique id.
# * Fix what happens when the same function is called repeatedly
#   from different parts. (Parameters, and variables)
# * When applying replace a variable value with the non-terminal
#   variable name, ensure that the replacement is done only on the
#   variables that are visible to the current variable.
# * Use simple taint-tracing or dataflow analysis to restrict the
#   number of rules in consideration when trying to do the
#   non-terminal replacement.
# * Use leave-n-out strategy to get the best non-terminal
#   replacements by avoiding spurious non-terminal inclusions.
# * When multiple matches are found for a variable value inside
#   a rule, include all combinations of the variable replacements
#   as rule choices.
# * Figure out better grammar compaction heuristics
# * Add a fuzzing step to test each individual choice in the rules
#   i.e. take a single input and the grammar derived from it, then
#   fuzz the input by using only a single choice and verify that
#   the choice is actually correct.
